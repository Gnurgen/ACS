    <question1>
      <title>Description of implementation and tests</title>
      <q1a>
        <text>
          Does the solution contain a clear description of the approach
          used to achieve before-or-after atomicity?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1a>
      <q1b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on any aspects that you found unclear in the
          description of the approach to achieve before-or-after atomicity
        </text>
        <answer>The description was clear.</answer>
      </q1b>
      <q1c>
        <text>
          Does the code include implementations of Tests 1 and 2 of the
          assignment description as well as of at least another two test
          cases?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1c>
      <q1d-i>
        <text>
          Is it tested that the final state resulting from concurrent
          execution
          is correct in that it respects invariants designed in the test?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1d-i>
      <q1d-ii>
        <text>
          Is it tested that intermediate reads of the state during concurrent
          execution respect invariants designed in the test, so that it is
          arguable that these intermediate states could be found in an
          equivalent serial schedule?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1d-ii>
      <q1e>
        <text>
          Provide comments on why you found that any portions of the test
          descriptions were unclear according to the criteria, and suggestions for
          improvement
        </text>
        <answer>When describing each test it would could have been good with the name 
                         of the test method, which would have made it easier to locate the different tests in the code.
                         In the description of test 4 (test of many clients) it is not mentioned how many clients are used(200,000
                         but only 1000 are running at a time).
                         With the manual locks, it shouldn't be necessary to use a concurrent hash map.

    <question2>
      <title>Correctness argument for locking protocol</title>
      <q2a>
        <text>
          Is the variant of 2PL to which equivalence is being established in
          the correctness argument clearly identified (e.g., conservative, strict,
          conservative strict)?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q2a>
      <q2b>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argumentation of why the steps in the locking
          protocol designed correspond to steps taken in the chosen variant
          of 2PL?
        </text>
        <answer>NO</answer>
      </q2b>
      <q2c>
        <text>
          Is there an argument for the need to take into account predicate
          reads, with appropriate justification?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q2c>
      <q2d>
        <text>
          Is there an argument for the need to take into account predicate
          reads, with appropriate justification?
        </text>
        <answer>The argument part is lacking. It is more a description of how they implemented the locking protocol, but an actual argument for why this protocol is correct is thin.</answer>
      </q2d>
    </question2>

    <question3>
      <title>Deadlocks</title>
      <q3a>
        <text>
          Does the solution contain a correct argument for why deadlocks can
          occur in the locking protocol or why deadlocks cannot occur?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q3a>
      <q3b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the argument provided with respect to
          deadlocks could be improved
        </text>
        <answer>Explain why conservative twi phase locking can not lead to deadlocks.</answer>
      </q3b>
    </question3>

    <question4>
      <title>Reflections on scalability</title>
      <q4a>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argument about the scalability limits of the
          concurrent implementation provided?
        </text>
        <answer>[YES/NO]</answer>
      </q4a>
      <q4b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the reflections on scalability could be

    <question5>
      <title>Argumentation on decisions made for performance</title>
      <q5a>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argument in the solution about the trade-off between
          locking overhead and concurrency?
        </text>
        <answer>[YES/NO]</answer>
      </q5a>
      <q5b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the argument about performance trade-offs in
          the locking protocol could be improved
